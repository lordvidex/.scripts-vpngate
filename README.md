Little go script to download latest .ovpn files from vpngate

## TODO
- [X] downloading profiles
- [X] osascript commands should install the profiles
- [X] deleting old and invalid profiles (cleanup commands)
- [ ] configuration for profiles that should be static i.e. never deleted by cleanup commands
